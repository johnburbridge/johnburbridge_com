## Welcome to the Blog!

This is the body of my **first blog post**. I'm using Astro's [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) feature.

Here's a list:

- Item 1
- Item 2

Testing a Mermaid JS graph:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

And here's a link:
[Visit Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)

We can add more content here later.
